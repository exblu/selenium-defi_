# Objectives

+ Streamline decentralized finance workflows
+ Improve oversight of transactional activities
+ Expand usability of DeFi platforms for diverse users

# Features

### Token Monitoring

The system observes activity related to newly listed tokens and applies configurable logic to track asset performance and trends over time.

### Fast Execution Layer

Manual confirmation steps can be slow. This tool integrates optimized communication with blockchain endpoints to streamline asset interactions.

### Asset Risk Management

Configure asset tracking parameters. In the event of abnormal activity or sharp price changes, the system may execute protective measures to minimize exposure based on user-defined rules.

### Liquidity Analysis

Optimized for low-fee transaction environments (e.g., post EIP-4844 chains), this tool enables liquidity interaction simulations that respect market conditions and configurable asset thresholds.

### Smart Rebalancing Logic

Includes customizable logic for portfolio strategy adjustments such as proportional allocation rebalancing and condition-based position entries/exits.

### Dynamic Order Strategies

Offers automation frameworks for trend-based scenarios such as entry on retracement (e.g., "buy on dip") and conditional trailing exit logic.

### Intelligent Asset Filtering

Users can define criteria to evaluate new digital assets across multiple decentralized platforms. The tool references publicly available data to provide filtered views based on customizable rules.

### Transaction Pool Listening

For educational purposes, users may observe pending blockchain interactions using a read-only connection to node providers, assisting in awareness of network activity patterns.

### DEX Integration

Supports analysis across various decentralized platforms. Reads available function data to better understand liquidity dynamics and support simulation of asset interaction scenarios.

### Execution Strategy Support

Utilizes time-sensitive modeling to study behavioral patterns in digital asset movements and constructs conceptual transaction groupings based on publicly visible blockchain data.

# Supported Platforms

Works with decentralized services including but not limited to: Ethereum-based chains, Layer-2 solutions, Terra, and BSC-compatible chains.

# Code Examples

Example smart contract logic for educational/demo purposes only:

#### Uniswap-style interaction:

```solidity

function swap(address assetIn, address assetOut, uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOutMin) public {
    require(pools[assetIn][assetOut].balance[assetIn] >= amountIn);
    pools[assetIn][assetOut].balance[assetIn] -= amountIn;
    pools[assetIn][assetOut].balance[assetOut] += amountOutMin;
    IERC20(assetOut).transfer(msg.sender, amountOutMin);
}

function createDAI(address asset, uint256 amount) public {
    require(collateralValue[asset] >= amount);
    dai.mint(msg.sender, amount);
    collateral[msg.sender][asset] += amount;
}

function borrow(address asset, uint256 amount) public {
    require(pools[asset].balance >= amount);
    pools[asset].balance -= amount;
    balances[msg.sender][asset] += amount;
    interestRates[msg.sender][asset] = pools[asset].interestRate;
}
```
